# Tic-tac-toe

## Overwiew

The goal of this personnal project was to recreate the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game.

I made two versions of it :

- A CLI version using Node.js
- A web version using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## CLI version

The CLI version is located in the console_game folder :
in order to play you have to:

- Clone the repo
- run `npm install` on your terminal
- cd into console_game folder
- run `node game.js`

### Functionnalities

This game should be played with 2 players, but you can be alone for it too.

- The game is asking you to choose where to play (starting with X)

  - The format of the answer must be "`<x> <y>`"

* Then it's 'O' player turn and so on

- Then you can play until someone wins or either it'll be a draw !

### Improvements

- Adding the possibility to restart the game by "Y/N" instead of retyping `node game.js`

- Asking the two players for their name before playing

- Adding an IA in order to play even if we're alone

### Bugs

No bugs currently known, feel free to report me if there's any.

## Web version

### Functionnalities

This is a traditionnal Tic-Tac-Toe game, X starts and you play as 2 players and wait until someone wins or it's a draw !

### Improvements

- Highlight the winning row
- Adding custom symbols
